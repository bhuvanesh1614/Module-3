# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program

```
x=("12", 8, "21", "10", "11", "52", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print("52" in tuple )
print("12" in tuple)
```
## Output
![444871227-1a4b8480-d27b-491c-ad60-e3e60c40857c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebe687a3-cda5-4dc1-97a1-5d604aa8b162)
## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
